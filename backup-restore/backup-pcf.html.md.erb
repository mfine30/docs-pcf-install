## <a id='encrypt-key'></a>Record the Cloud Controller Database Encryption Credentials ##

From the Product Installation Dashboard, select **Pivotal Elastic Runtime > Credentials** and locate the Cloud Controller section.
Record the Cloud Controller **DB encryption credentials**.
You must provide these credentials if you contact Pivotal Support for help
restoring your installation.

## <a id='export'></a>Export Installation Settings ##

Pivotal recommends that you back up your installation settings by exporting
frequently.
Always export an installation before following the steps in the [Import Installation Settings](./restore-pcf.html#import) section of the [Restoring Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; from Backup](./restore-pcf.html) topic.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Exporting your installation only backs up your installation settings. It does not back up your virtual machines (VMs) or any external MySQL databases.</p>

From the Product Installation Dashboard in the Ops Manager interface, click the gear icon and select **Export installation settings**.
This option is only available after you have deployed at least one time.

**Export installation settings** exports the current PCF installation
settings and assets.
When you export an installation, the exported file contains the base VM images,
all necessary packages, and references to the installation IP addresses.
As a result, an exported installation file can exceed 5 GB in size.

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: For versions of Ops Manager 1.3 or older, the process of archiving files for export may exceed the timeout limit of 600 seconds and result in a <code>500</code> error. To resolve this issue, you can manually increase the timeout value, or assign additional resources to the Ops Manager VM to improve performance. For more information, see the <a href="https://support.pivotal.io/hc/en-us/articles/206113627">Pivotal Support Knowledge Base</a>.</p>

## <a id='backup-databases'></a>Back Up Critical Backend Components ##

Your Elastic Runtime deployment contains several critical data stores that must be present for a complete restore. This section describes the procedure for backing up the databases and the servers associated with your PCF installation.

You must back up each of the following:

* Cloud Controller Database
* UAA Database
* Apps Manager Database
* NFS Server
* Pivotal MySQL Server

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you are running PostgreSQL and are on the default internal databases, follow the instructions below. If you are running your databases or filestores externally, disregard instructions for backing up the Cloud Controller, UAA, and Apps Manager Databases and ensure that you back up your external databases and filestores. </p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To follow the backup instructions below, your network must be configured to allow access to the BOSH Director virtual machine (VM) from your local machine. If you do not have local administrator access, use the <code>scp</code> command to copy the TAR file to the BOSH Director VM. For example:
<code> scp vcap@10.0.0.10:nfs.tar.gz \ </code>
and
<code>vcap@10.0.0.03:/nfs.tar.gz</code></p>

    </pre>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The TAR file that you create to back up NFS server might be large. To estimate the size of the TAR file before you create it, run the following command:
    <code class=''>ssh vcap@10.0.0.10 'tar -cf - /dir/to/archive/ | wc -c'</code></p>


### <a id='backup-mysql'></a>Back Up Pivotal MySQL Server ###

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The Elastic Runtime deploy contains an embedded MySQL Server that serves as the data store for the Application Usage Events, Notifications, and Autoscaler services. If you are using an internal MySQL, this will also include the Cloud Controller, UAA, and Apps Manager.</p>

The embedded MySQL Server is able to automatically back up its data to an external blobstore periodically. This functionality can be configured in the "MySQL Config" tab in ERT:
